	/// <summary>
	/// Map object that extends the LinkedHashMap map with support for insertion and retrieval of keys using special
	/// key path values.  The key path support nested maps and array values.
	/// <para>
	/// A key path consists of a sequence of key values separated by '.' characters.  Each part of the key path
	/// consists of a separate map.  For example a key path of 'k1.k2.k3' is a map containing a key 'k1' whose
	/// value is a map containing a key 'k2' whose values is a map containing a key 'k3'.   A key path can also
	/// contain an array notation '[<number>]' in which case the value of 'a' in the map is a list containing
	/// a map.  For example 'a[1].k2' refers to the key value 'k2' in the 2nd element of the list referred to by
	/// the value of key 'a' in the map.  If no index value is given (i.e., '[]') then a put() method appends
	/// to the list while a get() method returns the last value in the list.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// When using the array index notation the value inserted must be a map; inserting values is not permitted.
	/// For example using <code>put("a[3].k1", 1)</code> is permitted while <code>put("a[3]", 1)</code> results
	/// in an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// 
	/// Examples:
	/// <pre>
	/// RequestMap map  = new RequestMap();
	/// map.put("card.number", "5555555555554444");
	/// map.put("card.cvc", "123");
	/// map.put("card.expMonth", 5);
	/// map.put("card.expYear", 15);
	/// map.put("currency", "USD");
	/// map.put("amount", 1234);
	/// </pre>
	/// There is also an set() method which is similar to put() but returns the map providing a fluent map builder.
	/// <pre>
	/// RequestMap map = new RequestMap()
	///      .set("card.number", "5555555555554444")
	///      .set("card.cvc", "123")
	///      .set("card.expMonth", 5)
	///      .set("card.expYear", 15)
	///      .set("currency", "USD")
	///      .set("amount", 1234);
	/// </pre>
	/// Both of these examples construct a BaseMap containing the keys 'currency', 'amount' and 'card'.  The
	/// value for the 'card' key is a map containing the key 'number', 'cvc', 'expMonth' and 'expYear'.
